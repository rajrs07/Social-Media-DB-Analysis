# Social Media Database Project

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a comprehensive social media database with well-structured tables and carefully designed relationships using primary and foreign keys. The database includes separate tables for users, posts, comments, likes, followers, and tags. Advanced SQL queries were utilized to derive insights and extract data that can bring significant value to a company's operations.

## Objectives
- Build a robust social media database
- Use advanced SQL queries to extract insights that might be required in a work setting
- Provide valuable data to support business decisions

## Data Source
All the queries to create the database, tables, and import data are included in the file `Social Media Database Project.sql`. Running this file in a SQL workbench will build the complete database for review.

## Database Structure
The database consists of the following tables:
- **Users**: Contains user information
- **Posts**: Details of user posts
- **Comments**: User comments on posts
- **Likes**: Records of likes on posts
- **Followers**: User follow relationships
- **Tags**: Hashtags used in posts

## Key Queries and Insights
We used advanced SQL queries to answer the following questions:

1. **Who are the 5 oldest users?**
2. **On which day do most users register?**
3. **Find users who have never posted.**
4. **Which is the most liked photo?**
5. **How many times does the average user post?**
6. **What are the 5 most used hashtags?**
7. **Who are the users who have liked every post in the database?**

## Conclusion
By structuring the database and employing these queries, we can derive meaningful insights that are valuable for a company's marketing and operational strategies.
The data derived might be useful for a variety of departments such as marketing, customer retention, recognizing popular users, user behavior, user segmentation or providing user engagement for getting advertisements.

## How to Use
To replicate the analysis and build the database:
1. Download the `Social Media Database Project.sql` file.
2. Run the SQL script in your preferred SQL workbench.
3. Review and modify the queries as needed to explore additional insights.
